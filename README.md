# Spotify-data 
This Python code is used to find specific information on the Spotify platform. First, you need an Excel file containing the artist's name and the song title. The code will return an Excel file with the artist's name, the song title, and all the information about the song (e.g., tempo, speechness, loudness, etc.).
